My Client is Koda and she runs a photography business. She needs a website to market herself to potential clients.

It important to consider a mobile-first design because over half of the population access the internet on their phone.

My challenges were trying to understand how to do the mobile first coding specifically with my images. I had a hard time trying to get the code right because when I thought I had it, the image wouldn't size down when the screen would change. I overcame this by trying and starting over a few times until I finally came to a solution.
