1. The universal selector styles everything on the page which is useful for things like fonts. The element selector is used to style all elements of a certain type. For example, you may want all h1's to be blue. The class selector can be used to style elements that have a similar function. With this selector you could set all the important paragraphs to have red text. The ID selector is useful for styling specific elements. For example, you could give the first line of a paragraph an ID and make it have a larger font size.
2. I chose my colors by using Illustrator's color picker tool on one of my website images. The colors are #7888f1, #f8e084, #e918ed, and #f7acf8.
3. I have never used css before so that was a bit difficult for me and it took a lot of trial and error. However, I am happy with how my site came out.
