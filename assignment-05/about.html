  <h1>About the Author</h1>

<p>Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. After graduating
  high school and attending a summer course at San Diego School of Fine Arts,
  Don moved to New York, where he studied at the Art Students' League and
  developed a passion for theater. Don spent much of his time on Broadway and
  could often be found backstage, sketching actors and capturing everything that
  happened both on and off the stage in his sketchbook. He supported himself by
  playing his trumpet in a dance band, but after losing his trumpet on the
  subway Don decided to turn his attention to his sketches.</p>

  <p>Don made a name for himself from his successful Broadway sketches and took
    his first step into children's literature when he was asked to illustrate
    for William Saroya. He quickly began writing and illustrating his own
    children's books, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the C
    aldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low. He collaborated frequently with his
    wife, Lydia, a fellow author and artist. Don died in 1978, and his wife went
    on to establish The Lydia Freeman Charitable Foundation.</p>
