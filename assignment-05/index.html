  <h1>Corduroy</h1>
    <h2>Don Freeman</h2>

<hr />

<p>The book tells the story of a teddy bear named Corduroy, displayed on a toy
  shelf in a department store. One day, a young girl named Lisa arrives at the
  store with her mother and spots the bear. She is eager to buy him, but her
  mother refuses to spend more money. In addition, she notices that the bear is
  missing a button from his overalls and points this out to Lisa in an attempt
  to convince her that the bear isn't worth it.</p>

  <p>At night, when the shoppers and the people of the department store have
    gone (and the doors were closed and locked), little Corduroy (when no one is
    looking) decides to find the missing button himself and goes on a trip
    around the department store. He rides an escalator and takes himself to the
    second floor. There, he finds furniture he had never seen before. There were
    tables, chairs, lamps, sofas, and rows of beds. Corduroy admires the
    furniture and crawls onto a mattress from one of the beds. Meanwhile, he saw
    something small and round. Thinking that one of the mattress buttons is the
    one he is missing, he pulls hard on it and eventually topples from the bed,
    knocking over a lamp. The store security guard (in the book called a "night
    watchman") hears the noise from the third floor, discovers the bear, and
    returns him to his place (which is the toy department that stored the other
    dolls and stuffed animals).</p>

    <p>The next day, Lisa comes back with the money she had found in her piggy
      bank and finally buys Corduroy. At home, she sews a button on his shoulder
      strap and the book ends with them saying that they both had wanted a
      friend. The picture depicts Lisa and Corduroy hugging each other.</p>
