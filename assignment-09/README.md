I have not been in a Web Design class since I was in Highschool but I do use some HTML at my current job so it has been a nice refresher. I found that a lot of things came back to me such as the basics of tables and linking but there were things like divs that I haven't done in years that I had a challenge understanding.

I only have experience in HTML so I am nervous to learn a new coding language. That being said, I have seen some of the things you can do on CSS and I am excited for the stylistic capabilities of CSS.

My main success this week was learning how to add a background image to a webpage but I could not figure out how to change the opacity of just that image and not the rest of the content in the body element.
