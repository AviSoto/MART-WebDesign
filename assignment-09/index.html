<div id="What you'll need:"class="container">
  <h1>What you'll need:</h1>
  <p>The materials for making these sheets of papel picado are pretty basic. Just some colorful printer paper and some string. You'll of course also need vector files of the
    designs you want to cut and access to a laser cutter – I have my own, but for years used the one at my local maker space, and if you're located anywhere near a decent sized city,
    there are likely similar maker spaces near you that you can join. Many universities and libraries also have lasers that may be available to you!</p>

<div class="container tools">

<b>Tools Used:</b>

  <li>Laser cutter</li>
  <li>Hole punch (I decided later to add my holes, but these can be cut on the laser too)</li>

<b>Supplies </b>
<li>Colored Printer Paper</li>
<li>Twine / String</li>
<li>Vector Papel Picado designs</li></p>

<hr>

<p>For the design of the sheets I'd end up cutting, I started by researching papel picado designs that I liked to get a feel for what I liked in various
  designs. The first few I made were done by basically tracing photos of ones I had found and liked using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>After I got a feel for what I liked with the first few, I tried my hand at a making a few completely custom designs. The green eagle sheet in
  the photo above is one such example – eagles aren't traditionally used in papel picado designs, but my father-in-law passed away this year, and he
  loved eagles, so I thought I would make that one to honor him.</p>

<p>If you're not quite up for custom designing papel picado templates and, you can find some free files online or buy them from a stock vector site
  like Creative Market or even Etsy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Before we get started cutting our fancy colorful paper, let's use some basic white printer paper to dial in our settings. Regardless
of what kind of laser cutter you'll be using, the power requirements here will probably be super low, so I started there.</p>

<p>For my first test cut, I cut one sheet at 100% speed and 5% power, with high speed air assist on my laser turned off so that the
  paper stayed in place. This cut through perfectly fine without any trouble, so I tried cutting 5 sheets at a time without changing the settings.</p>

<p>This cut through fine as well, but I observed that there was a small amount of brown burnt residue that got trapped between the layers of paper,
  and it didn’t rub off easily. Since this wasn’t a problem with the individual test sheet, I imagined this was due to the laser vaporizing the
  additional material and it getting trapped in the tiny air pockets between the pages.</p>

<p>Still wanting to cut multiple pages at once to save time, I decided I’d split the difference and cut 2-3 sheets at a time to minimize that residue.
  I also determined that the residue probably wouldn’t be as visible on the colored paper as it was on the bright white printer paper. Besides, these
  aren’t going to be observed close up – they’ll be strung on a string and hung up above head-level in most cases, so a little burn residue on the edges
  shouldn’t matter.</p>

<hr>

<p>Next up, the fun part! Cutting your designs into the colorful paper! If you cut multiple colors at one time, it's super fun to watch, as tiny pieces of paper
  get flung about and the laser is basically making confetti.</p>

<p>For paper, I used a type I found at my local Target called "Astrobrights" and was really pleased with the variety of bright and vivid colors that were also
  culturally appropriate for Día de Muertos.</p>

<p>After cutting your sheets out and removing them, it's easiest to clean your cutting bed with a shop vac, rather than trying to remove all the scraps of paper
  yourself.</p>

<hr>

<p>Once all of your sheets are cut, it's time to string them up and make a banner! You'll want to lay out your designs in the order you plan to hang them from your
string. It'll look the best if you can alternate colors and patterns, trying not to have too much repetition.</p>

<p>With your order determined, you can "thread" the sheets onto your string, one by one, with the string entering the hole on the left of each sheet, coming around
the back out through the right hole, and repeating this on each one.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use holes to mount them to the string, you can fold over the top edge of each sheet and tape them to the string, but the hole method is nice
and quick, and gives some adjustability once hung up.</p>

<hr>

<p>After they are all threaded, you can carefully secure one end of the string to the wall (or wherever you plan to hang your papel picado banner), followed by the
  other end. If you used the hole method to mount, this is also a good opportunity to adjust the spacing of each sheet to make sure everything appears even.</p>
